# Pharmacy-Management-System : Project Overview :

Welcome to the Pharmacy Management System! This project is designed as an introduction to databases, MySQL, and Python with Tkinter GUI. This application allows you to efficiently manage your pharmacy's medicine inventory. You can easily add new medicines, update existing ones, and keep track of all your medicines. The system is divided into three main sections:

## Sections of the App

  * **Add New Medicines :** Input the reference number and name of any new medicine to add it to the database.
  * **Modify Existing Medicines :** Update the name of any existing medicine.
  * **Delete Medicines :** Remove any medicines that are no longer required.
All newly added medicines are stored and displayed in a table in this section. Operation buttons for adding, modifying, and deleting are conveniently located next to this medicine table.

### 2. Medicine Information

This section allows you to :

  * **Add Information :** Update and add information regarding newly added medicines.
  * **Modify Existing Records :** Update information for existing medicines.

All operation buttons for these actions are located just below this section. All the medicines along with their information are stored and displayed in the inventory table present below this sectio.
